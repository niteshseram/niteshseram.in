				<p>
					Hello there, I&apos;m a <b>Software Engineer</b> with a passion for
					all things frontend. I work at a vibrant startup called <b>Auzmor</b>,
					where I spend my days building innovative learning management
					solutions that make a difference in people&apos;s lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a lifelong learner, I&apos;m always looking for opportunities to
					grow and push myself to new heights. That&apos;s why I love
					contributing to <b>Open Source</b> projects whenever I can - it&apos;s
					a chance to collaborate with other talented developers and make a real
					impact on the world.
				</p>

				<h4 className='text-lg md:text-xl font-medium dark:text-light text-dark'>
					When I&apos; not at my desk...
				</h4>
				<p>
					Don&apos;t let all that talk of coding fool you - I&apos;m also a big
					believer in having fun and trying to have balance between work and
					play. That&apos;s why you&apos;ll often find me hitting the gym trying
					to stay fit and healthy, hanging out with friends or enjoying a good
					Netflix and chill session, I&apos;m always up for an adventure.
